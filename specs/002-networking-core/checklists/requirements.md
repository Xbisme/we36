# Specification Quality Checklist: Networking, Cache & Realtime Core

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- This is an infrastructure spec: its "users" are feature teams and the app itself. User
  stories are framed as developer/consumer journeys but remain value-oriented and
  independently testable.
- Concrete package/version choices (HTTP client, Socket.IO-compatible realtime client,
  drift) are deliberately deferred to `/speckit.plan` per project stack standards — the
  spec body stays capability-focused (mechanism + behavior), with decided-stack notes
  confined to the Assumptions section.
- The error-code catalog and envelope shapes are quoted verbatim from the backend contract
  (contract-stable); these are domain constraints, not implementation leakage.
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
  All items currently pass.
